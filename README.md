Conditional Practice Problems in Python 3.12.4

Overview:

This repository contains a collection of real-world conditional practice problems solved using Python 3.12.4. These problems focus on using conditional statements like if, elif, and else to simulate decision-making scenarios. This is an essential part of learning to think like a programmer and solving problems that require logical decision-making.

Learning Journey:

Conditionals are a key part of writing programs that respond to different situations based on input or circumstances. Through this repository, I’ve tackled a wide range of practical scenarios using conditionals. This hands-on experience has improved my ability to write decision-based logic and solve real-world problems efficiently.

Technologies Used:

Python 3.12.4
Python is the primary programming language used to demonstrate how conditional statements can solve problems.

Practice Problems:
Below are the real-world practice problems I’ve worked on:

1)Weather Advisory
Write a program that checks if the temperature is below freezing, above a heat threshold, or within a comfortable range, and provides appropriate advice.

2)Movie Rating
Determine if a person can watch a movie based on their age and the movie's rating (G, PG, PG-13, R).

3)Flight Status
Check if a flight is on time, delayed, or canceled based on its current status.

4)Restaurant Seating
Write a program that determines if there are available seats in a restaurant and if a reservation is needed based on the current time and seating capacity.

5)Online Shopping Discount
Apply a discount if the total purchase amount exceeds a certain threshold.

6)Bank Loan Eligibility
Determine if a person is eligible for a bank loan based on their credit score and income.

7)Parking Fee Calculation
Calculate the parking fee based on the hours parked, with different rates for short-term and long-term parking.

8)Gym Membership
Check if a person qualifies for a student discount on a gym membership based on their age and student ID.

9)Online Exam Access
Allow or deny access to an online exam based on the current date and the exam's availability period.

10)Hotel Room Availability
Check if a hotel room is available based on the date and room type.

11)Traffic Light Simulation
Simulate a traffic light and determine the action (stop, ready, go) based on the current state.

12)Library Membership
Determine the membership fee for a library based on the member's age and membership type (individual, family, senior).

13)Tax Calculation
Write a program to calculate the tax to be paid based on income brackets and tax rates.

14)Festival Discount
Apply special discounts during a festival period.

15)Insurance Premium
Calculate the insurance premium based on the type of coverage and the insured amount.

Conclusion:

By solving these conditional problems, I’ve significantly improved my ability to write clean and efficient decision-making logic. I now have a better grasp of applying conditionals in real-world scenarios, which will help me as I progress in more complex programming tasks.
